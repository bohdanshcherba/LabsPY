# About 

This is the code of lab work for learning Python here is the task.
Write code from lab2(UML)When writing a program, you need to use the python code convention.Classes need to be properly divided into packages.
Working with the console or console menu should be minimal.
Only those classes that are on the class diagram should be present in the code.
The attributes of the classes and their visibility must match those indicated in the class diagram. The same goes for class methods.
Use the built-in sorting methods available in Python to sort
Sorting should be implemented in a separate method
The code does not contain static methods / attributes. Code must use enum type
The code should be filled in a separate repository, having previously created a pull request
(ie the code should be written in a separate branch on its basis to make a pull request)
To test the operation of your code, you need to create a separate class in which the main method will be located
